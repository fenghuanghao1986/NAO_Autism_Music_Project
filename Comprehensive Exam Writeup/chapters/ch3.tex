\chapter{Xylo-Bot: An Interactive Music Teaching System} 
A novelty Interactive human-robot music teaching system design is presented in 
this chapter. Two In order to make robot play xylophone properly, several things need 
to be done before that. First is to find a proper xylophone with correct timber; 
second, we have to make the xylophone in a proper position in front of the robot 
that makes it to be seen properly and be reached to play; finally, design the 
intelligent music system for NAO.\\

\section{NAO: A Humanoid Robot}
We used a humanoid  robot called NAO developed by Aldebaran Robotics in France. 
NAO is 58 cm (23 inches) tall, with 25 degrees of freedom this robot 
can conduct most of the human behaviors. It also features an onboard multimedia 
system including, four microphones for voice recognition, and sound localization, 
two speakers for text-to-speech synthesis, and two HD cameras with maximum image 
resolution 1280 x 960 for online observation. As shown in Figure somewhere, these 
utilities are located in the middle of the forehead and the mouth area. NAOâ€™s 
computer vision module includes facial and shape recognition units. By using the 
vision feature of the robot, that allows the robot be able to see the instrument 
from its lower camera and be able to do implement a eye-arm self-calibration 
system which allows the robot to have real-time micro-adjustment of its 
arm-joints in case of off positioning during music playing.\\

The robot arms have a length of approximately 31 cm. Each arm have five degrees 
of freedom and is equipped with the sensors to measure the position of each 
joint. To determine the pose of the instrument and the beaters' heads the robot 
analyzes images from the lower monocular camera located in its head, which has a 
diagonal field of view of 73 degree. These dimensions allows us to choose a 
proper instrument presented in next section.\\

Four microphones embedded on toy or NAO's head locations see figure somewhere. 
According the official Aldebaran documentation, these microphones has sensitivity 
of 20mV/Pa +/-3dB at 1kHz, and the input frequency range of 150Hz - 12kHz, data 
will be recorded as a 16 bits, 48000Hz, 4 channels wav file which meets the 
requirements for designing the online feedback audio score system which will be 
described below.\\

\section{Accessories}
The purpose of this study is to have a toy size humanoid robot to play music,
some necessary accessories need to be purchased and made before teach the robot
to play music. All accessories will be discussed in the following sections.\\

\subsection{Xylophone: A Toy for Music Beginner}
In this system, according NAO's open arms' length, we choose a Sonor Toy Sound SM soprano-xylophone with 11 sound bars of 2 cm in width. The instrument has a size of 
31 cm x 9.5 cm x 4 cm, including the resonateing body. The smallest sound bar is 
playable in an area of 2.8 cm x 2 cm, the largest in an area of 4.8 cm x 2 cm. The 
instrument is diatonically tuned in C-Major/a-minor. The beaters/mallets, we use 
the pair which come with the xylophone with a modified 3D printed grips (details in next 
subsection) to allow the robot's hands to hold them properly. The mallets 
are approximately 21 cm in length include a head of 0.8 cm radius.\\ 
%(see figure somewhere with real instrument)
11 bars represent 11 different notes (11 frequencies) which covers 
approximate one and half octave scale starting from C6 to F7. \\
%(see figures or a table with different frequencies somewhere)

\subsection{Mallet Gripper Design}
According to NAO's hands size, we designed and 3D printed a pair of gripers to 
have the robot be able to hold the mallets properly. All dimensions can be found 
in figure somewhere.\\

\subsection{Instrument Stand Design}
A wooden base has designed and laser cut to hold the instrument in a proper place 
in order to have the robot be able to play music. All dimensions can be found in 
figure somewhere below.\\

\section{Module-Based Acoustic Music Interactive System Design}
In this section, a novelty module-based robot-music teaching system will be presented. 
Three modules have built in this intelligent system including module 1: eye-hand 
self-calibration micro-adjustment; module 2: joint trajectory generator; and 
module 3: real time performance scoring feedback. \\
% show a block diagram figure somewhere presenting the whole system

\subsection{Module 1: Eye-hand Self-Calibration Micro-Adjustment}
Knowledge about the parameters of the robot's kinematic model is essential for 
tasks requiring high precision such as playing the xylophone. While the kinematic 
structure is known from the construction plan, errors can occur, e.g., due to the 
imperfect manufacturing. After multiple times of test, the targeted angle chain 
of arms never equals to the returned chain in reality. We therefore use a 
calibration method to accurately eliminate these errors.\\
 

\subsubsection{A. Color-Based Object Tracking}
To play the xylophone, the robot has to be able to adjust its motions according to
the estimated relative poses of the instrument and the heads of the beaters it is 
holding. The approach to estimating these poses which adopted in this thesis, we 
uses a color-based technique.\\
The main idea is, based on the RGB color of the center blue bar, given a hypothesis 
about the instrument's pose, one can project the contour of the object's model into the 
camera image and compare them to actually observed contour. In this way, it is possible 
to estimate the likelihood of the pose hypothesis. By using this method, it allows
the robot to track the instrument with very low cost in real-time.\\

%to show a flow chart regarding how to implement in the code

\subsubsection{B. Calibration of Kinematic Parameters}
(In progress, will not present in this version. The idea is to use both positions 
of the instrument and beaters' heads to computes for each sound bar a suitable 
beating configuration for arm kinematics chain. Suitable means that the beater's 
head can be placed on the surface of the sound bar at the desired angle. From 
this configuration, the control points of a predefined beating motion are updated.)\\ 

\subsection{Module 2: Joint Trajectory Generator}
Our system parses a list of hex-decimal numbers (from 1 to b) to obtain the sequence
of notes to play. It converts the notes into a joint trajectory using the beating
configurations obtained from inverse kinematic as control points. The timestamps
for the control points will be defined by user in order to meet the experiment requirement.
The trajectory is then computed using Bezier interpolation in joint space by the
manufacturer-provided API and send to the robot controller for execution. In this
way, the robot plays in-time with the song.\\

\subsection{Module 3: Real-Time Performance Scoring Feedback}
The purpose of this system is to provide a real-life interaction experience using 
music therapy to teach kids social skills and music knowledge.  In this scoring 
system, two core features have designed to complete the task: 1) music detection;
2) intelligent scoring-feedback system.\\


\subsubsection{A. Music Detection}
Music, in the understanding of science and technology can be considered as a combination 
of time and frequency. In order to make robot detects a sequence of frequencies, we adopt the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to this audio feedback system. This allows the robot to 
be able to understands the music played by users and provide the proper feedback as
a music teaching instructor.\\

The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) , is a Fourier-related transform used to 
determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal 
as it changes over time. In practice, the procedure for computing STFTs is to divide 
a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute the 
Fourier transform separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier 
spectrum on each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as 
a function of time.In the discrete time case, the data to be transformed could 
be broken up into chunks or frames (which usually overlap each other, to reduce 
artifacts at the boundary). Each chunk is Fourier transformed, and the complex 
result is added to a matrix, which records magnitude and phase for each point in 
time and frequency. This can be expressed as:
\\

${\displaystyle \mathbf {STFT} \{x[n]\}(m,\omega )\equiv X(m,\omega )=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }x[n]w[n-m]e^{-j\omega n}}$
\\

likewise, with signal x[n] and window w[n]. In this case, m is discrete and $\omega$ 
is continuous, but in most typical applications the STFT is performed on a computer 
using the Fast Fourier Transform, so both variables are discrete and quantized.\\
The magnitude squared of the STFT yields the spectrogram representation of the Power 
Spectral Density of the function:
\\

${\displaystyle \operatorname {spectrogram} \{x(t)\}(\tau ,\omega )\equiv |X(\tau ,\omega )|^{2}}$\\

After robot detect the notes from user input, a list of hex-decimal number will be
returned, this list will be used in two purposes: 1) compared with target list
for scoring and send feedback to user; 2) use this list as a new input to have
robot playback in the game session which will be discussed in next chapter.\\
% show a spectrugram here with different note frequency

\subsubsection{B. Intelligent Scoring-Feedback System}
In order to compare the detected notes and the target notes, we used an algorithm
which normally used in information theory, linguistics called Levenshtein Distance.
This algorithm is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.\\

In our case, the Levenshtein distance between two string like hex-decimal numbers 
${\displaystyle a,b}$ (of length ${\displaystyle |a|}$ and ${\displaystyle |b|}$ respectively) 
is given by ${\displaystyle \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(|a|,|b|)}$ where
\\

${\displaystyle \qquad \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j)={\begin{cases}\max(i,j)&{\text{ if }}\min(i,j)=0,\\\min {\begin{cases}\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i-1,j)+1\\\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j-1)+1\\\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i-1,j-1)+1_{(a_{i}\neq b_{j})}\end{cases}}&{\text{ otherwise.}}\end{cases}}}$\\
\\

where ${\displaystyle 1_{(a_{i}\neq b_{j})}}$ is the indicator function equal to 0 when 
${\displaystyle a_{i}=b_{j}}$ and equal to 1 otherwise, and ${\displaystyle \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j)}$ 
is the distance between the first ${\displaystyle i}$ characters of ${\displaystyle a}$ and the
first ${\displaystyle j}$ characters of ${\displaystyle b}$.

Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to deletion (from ${\displaystyle a}$ to 
${\displaystyle b}$), the second to insertion and the third to match or mismatch, depending on 
whether the respective symbols are the same.\\
% add a table here to show how to get the distance from two strings

Based on the real life situation, we define a likelihood margin for determine whether the result
is good or bad: \\
  
${likelihood = \dfrac{len(target) - lev_{target,source}}{len(target)}}$\\

where if the likelihood is greater than 66\% ~ 72\%, system will consider it as a good result.
This result will be passed to the accuracy calculation system to have robot decide whether it
need to add more dosage to the practice. More details will be discussed in the next chapters
which related to experiment design.\\

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, based on the purpose of this research, we have discussed both hardware
and software design for getting ready to design the experiment sessions.\\

From Chapter One, we determined to have NAO as a music teaching instructor be able
to teach children simple music and be able to deliver social content in the mean time.
In order to have the system ready, first of all, we have to choose the proper agent which should be a
kids friendly with social ability robot NAO. Second, based on the size of the robot, some necessary
accessories have to purchased and handcrafted. A toy size color coded xylophone became the
best option and based on the size and position, a wooden based xylophone stand was 
customized and assembled. Due to the limitation of NAO's hand size, a pair of mallet gripers 
have been 3-D printed and customized. Last, a intelligent module-based acoustic music 
interactive system has designed from scratch. Three modules has designed to have the
robot to play, listen and teach the music freely and can become a great companion for children
in both music learning and social life. \\

Module 1 provides a autonomous self awareness positioning system for robot to localize
the instrument and make micro adjustment for arm joints in order to play the note bar properly.
Module 2 allows robot to be able to play any customized song behave of user's requests. That
means, any songs which can be translated to either C-Major or a-minor key, once a well trained
person type in the hex-decimal playable score, robot should be play it in seconds. Module 3
is designed for providing real life music teaching experience for system users. Two key features
of this module are designed: music detection and smart scoring feedback. Short time Fourier transform
and Levenshtein distance are adopted to fulfill the requirement which allows the robot understands
music and providing proper dosage of practice and oral feedback to users.\\
