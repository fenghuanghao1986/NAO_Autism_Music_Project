\chapter{Xylo-Bot: An Interactive Music Teaching System} 
A novelty Interactive human-robot music teaching system design is presented in 
this chapter. Two In order to make robot play xylophone properly, several things need 
to be done before that. First is to find a proper xylophone with correct timber; 
second, we have to make the xylophone in a proper position in front of the robot 
that makes it to be seen properly and be reached to play; finally, design the 
intelligent music system for NAO.\\

\section{NAO: A Humanoid Robot}
We used a humanoid  robot called NAO developed by Aldebaran Robotics in France. 
NAO is 58 cm (23 inches) tall, with 25 degrees of freedom this robot 
can conduct most of the human behaviors. It also features an onboard multimedia 
system including, four microphones for voice recognition, and sound localization, 
two speakers for text-to-speech synthesis, and two HD cameras with maximum image 
resolution 1280 x 960 for online observation. As shown in Figure somewhere, these 
utilities are located in the middle of the forehead and the mouth area. NAOâ€™s 
computer vision module includes facial and shape recognition units. By using the 
vision feature of the robot, that allows the robot be able to see the instrument 
from its lower camera and be able to do implement a eye-arm self-calibration 
system which allows the robot to have real-time micro-adjustment of its 
arm-joints in case of off positioning during music playing.\\
The robot arms have a length of approximately 31 cm. Each arm have five degrees 
of freedom and is equipped with the sensors to measure the position of each 
joint. To determine the pose of the instrument and the beaters' heads the robot 
analyzes images from the lower monocular camera located in its head, which has a 
diagonal field of view of 73 degree. These dimensions allows us to choose a 
proper instrument presented in next section.\\
Four microphones embedded on toy or NAO's head locations see figure somewhere. 
According the official Aldebaran documentation, these microphones has sensitivity 
of 20mV/Pa +/-3dB at 1kHz, and the input frequency range of 150Hz - 12kHz, data 
will be recorded as a 16 bits, 48000Hz, 4 channels wav file which meets the 
requirements for designing the online feedback audio score system which will be 
described below.\\

\section{Accessories}
The purpose of this study is to have a toy size humanoid robot to play music,
some necessary accessories need to be purchased and made before teach the robot
to play music. All accessories will be discussed in the following sections.\\

\subsection{Xylophone: A Toy for Music Beginner}
In this system, according NAO's open arms' length, we choose a Sonor Toy Sound SM soprano-xylophone with 11 sound bars of 2 cm in width. The instrument has a size of 
31 cm x 9.5 cm x 4 cm, including the resonateing body. The smallest sound bar is 
playable in an area of 2.8 cm x 2 cm, the largest in an area of 4.8 cm x 2 cm. The 
instrument is diatonically tuned in C-Major/a-minor. The beaters/mallets, we use 
the pair which come with the xylophone with a modified 3D printed grips (details in next 
subsection) to allow the robot's hands to hold them properly. The mallets 
are approximately 21 cm in length include a head of 0.8 cm radius.\\ 
%(see figure somewhere with real instrument)
11 bars represent 11 different notes (11 frequencies) which covers 
approximate one and half octave scale starting from C6 to F7. \\
%(see figures or a table with different frequencies somewhere)

\subsection{Mallet Gripper Design}
According to NAO's hands size, we designed and 3D printed a pair of gripers to 
have the robot be able to hold the mallets properly. All dimensions can be found 
in figure somewhere.\\
%(attach both solidworkds and actural pics somewhere)

\subsection{Instrument Stand Design}
A wooden base has designed and laser cut to hold the instrument in a proper place 
in order to have the robot be able to play music. All dimensions can be found in 
figure somewhere below. (attach both actual and solidworks pics somewhere blow)\\

\section{Module-Based Acoustic Music Interactive System Design}
In this section, a novelty module-based robot-music teaching system will be presented. 
Three modules have built in this intelligent system including module 1: eye-hand 
self-calibration micro-adjustment; module 2: joint trajectory generator; and 
module 3: real time performance scoring feedback. (see a block diagram figure 
somewhere presenting the whole system)

\subsection{Module 1: Eye-hand Self-Calibration Micro-Adjustment}
Knowledge about the parameters of the robot's kinematic model is essential for 
tasks requiring high precision such as playing the xylophone. While the kinematic 
structure is known from the construction plan, errors can occur, e.g., due to the 
imperfect manufacturing. After multiple times of test, the targeted angle chain 
of arms never equals to the returned chain in reality. We therefore use a 
calibration method to accurately eliminate these errors.\\
 

\subsubsection{A. Color-Based Object Tracking}
To play the xylophone, the robot has to be able to adjust its motions according to
the estimated relative poses of the instrument and the heads of the beaters it is 
holding. The approach to estimating these poses which adopted in this thesis, we 
uses a color-based technique.\\
The main idea is, based on the RGB color of the center blue bar, given a hypothesis 
about the instrument's pose, one can project the contour of the object's model into the 
camera image and compare them to actually observed contour. In this way, it is possible 
to estimate the likelihood of the pose hypothesis. By using this method, it allows
the robot to track the instrument with very low cost in real-time.\\
%(see figure some where, need a sequence of screen shot to show hot it works, possibly
to show a flow chart regarding how to implement in the code)

\subsubsection{B. Calibration of Kinematic Parameters}
(In progress, will not present in this version. The idea is to use both positions 
of the instrument and beaters' heads to computes for each sound bar a suitable 
beating configuration for arm kinematics chain. Suitable means that the beater's 
head can be placed on the surface of the sound bar at the desired angle. From 
this configuration, the control points of a predefined beating motion are updated.)\\ 

\subsection{Module 2: Joint Trajectory Generator}
Our system parses a list of numerical numbers (from 1 to 11) to obtain the sequence
of notes to play. It converts the notes into a joint trajectory using the beating
configurations obtained from inverse kinematic as control points. The timestamps
for the control points will be defined by user in order to meet the experiment requirement.
The trajectory is then computed using Bezier interpolation in joint space by the
manufacturer-provided API and send to the robot controller for execution. In this
way, the robot plays in-time with the song.\\

\subsection{Module 3: Real-Time Performance Scoring Feedback}
The purpose of this system is to provide a real-life interaction experience using 
music therapy to teach kids social skills and music knowledge.  In this scoring 
system, two core features have designed to complete the task: 1) music detection;
2) intelligent scoring-feedback system.\\


\subsubsection{A. Music Detection}
Music, in the understanding of science and technology can be considered as a combination 
of time and frequency. For robot to detect a sequence of frequencies, we adopt the 
short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to this audio feedback system. This allows the robot to 
be able to understands the music played by users and provide the proper feedback as
a music teaching instructor.\\

The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) , is a Fourier-related transform used to 
determine the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of local sections of a signal 
as it changes over time. In practice, the procedure for computing STFTs is to divide 
a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute the 
Fourier transform separately on each shorter segment. This reveals the Fourier 
spectrum on each shorter segment. One then usually plots the changing spectra as 
a function of time.In the discrete time case, the data to be transformed could 
be broken up into chunks or frames (which usually overlap each other, to reduce 
artifacts at the boundary). Each chunk is Fourier transformed, and the complex 
result is added to a matrix, which records magnitude and phase for each point in 
time and frequency. This can be expressed as:

${\displaystyle \mathbf {STFT} \{x[n]\}(m,\omega )\equiv X(m,\omega )=\sum _{n=-\infty }^{\infty }x[n]w[n-m]e^{-j\omega n}}$

likewise, with signal x[n] and window w[n]. In this case, m is discrete and $\omega$ 
is continuous, but in most typical applications the STFT is performed on a computer 
using the Fast Fourier Transform, so both variables are discrete and quantized.\\
The magnitude squared of the STFT yields the spectrogram representation of the Power 
Spectral Density of the function:

${\displaystyle \operatorname {spectrogram} \{x(t)\}(\tau ,\omega )\equiv |X(\tau ,\omega )|^{2}}$

\subsubsection{B. Intelligent Scoring-Feedback System}
By using the result detected by STFT, 


The Levenshtein distance between two strings ${\displaystyle a,b}$ (of length ${\displaystyle |a|}$ 
and ${\displaystyle |b|}$ respectively) is given by ${\displaystyle \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(|a|,|b|)}$ where

${\displaystyle \qquad \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j)={\begin{cases}\max(i,j)&{\text{ if }}\min(i,j)=0,\\\min {\begin{cases}\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i-1,j)+1\\\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j-1)+1\\\operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i-1,j-1)+1_{(a_{i}\neq b_{j})}\end{cases}}&{\text{ otherwise.}}\end{cases}}}$\\


where ${\displaystyle 1_{(a_{i}\neq b_{j})}}$ is the indicator function equal to 0 when 
${\displaystyle a_{i}=b_{j}}$ and equal to 1 otherwise, and ${\displaystyle \operatorname {lev} _{a,b}(i,j)}$ 
is the distance between the first ${\displaystyle i}$ characters of ${\displaystyle a}$ and the
 first ${\displaystyle j}$ characters of ${\displaystyle b}$.

Note that the first element in the minimum corresponds to deletion (from ${\displaystyle a}$ to ${\displaystyle b}$), 
the second to insertion and the third to match or mismatch, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same.
