Part1: corresponds to the first set of games that was designed for the first protocol experiments for NAO + ASD/TD. IN this experiments the eye gaze has been coded at look at(1)/away(0). We coded eye gaze for two sub-tasks (e.g. NAO talking and Kid Talking). For each of these segments we concatenated the eye gaze code for each frame, and come up with a sequence of frames. then we define one alphabet (word) for each sequence and then will use these alphabets for representing and modeling the eye gaze patterns of both TD and ASD kids.
