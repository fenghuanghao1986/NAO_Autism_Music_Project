% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex






% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").

% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided

% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.

\IEEEPARstart{M}{usic}, performed by instrument, is created to express emotions. 
However, learning how to play can be a different story, even to those who have talent in music.
Facial expressions could be a reliable representation of emotions from individuals for most
of the cases. However, it could be challenge for specific populations such as Autism Spectrum
Disorders (ASDs), a grouping of disorders characterized by profound difficulties with social
interaction, have demonstrated impairments in facial emotion recognition. Indeed, Kanner (1943)
originally described autism as a 'disorder of affective contact', and the current DSM-IV-TR 
diagnostic criteria for ASDs include items related to deficits in identifying and processing 
emotions: "marked impairments in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors, such as ...facial
expression..." and "lack of social or emotional reciprocity" (APA 2000). 
There are three different perspectives dealing with affect in multimedia,
namely, expressed emotions, felt emotions and expected emotions,

\section{Background}
%\subsection{Continuous Emotion Classification}
\subsection{Autism}
Individuals with autism spectrum disorder experience verbal and nonverbal
communication impairments, including motor control, emotional facial expressions, and
eye gaze attention. Oftentimes, individuals with high-functioning autism have deficits in
different areas, such as (1) language delay, (2) difficulty in having empathy with their peer
and understanding others emotions (i.e. facial expressions recognition.), and more
remarkably (3) joint attention (i.e. eye contact and eye gaze attention). Autism is a disorder
that appears in infancy \cite{Epidemiology1966}. Although there is no single accepted intervention, treatment,
or known cure for ASDs, these individual will have more successful treatment if ASD is
diagnosed in early stages. At the first glance at the individual with autism, you may not
notice anything odd, however after trying to talk to her/him, you will understand something
is definitely not right \cite{BrokenMirror2006}. S/He may not make eye contact with you and avoid your gaze
and fidget, rock her/his body and bang her/his head against the wall \cite{BrokenMirror2006}.
In early 1990s, researchers in the University of California at San Diego aimed to
find out the connections between autism and nervous system (i.e. mirror neurons). Mirror
neuron \cite{BrokenMirror2006} is a neuron that is activated either when a human acts an action or observes the
same action performed by others. As these neurons are involved with the abilities such as
empathy and perception of other individual’s intentions or emotions, they came up with 
malfunctioning of mirror neuron in individuals with ASD \cite{BrokenMirror2006}. There are several studies
that focus on the neurological deficits of individuals with autism and studying on their
brain activities. Figure 2-1 demonstrates the areas in the brain that causes the reduce mirror
neuron activities in individuals with autism.\\

Individuals with autism might also have several other unusual social developmental
behaviors that may appear in infancy or childhood. For instance children with autism show
less attention to social stimuli (e.g. facial expressions, joint attention), and respond less
when calling their names. Compared with typically developing children, older children or
adults with autism can read facial expressions less effectively and recognize emotions
behind specific facial expressions or the tone of voice with difficulties \cite{LogicScien1959}. In contrast to
TD individuals, children with autism (i.e. high-functioning, Asperger syndrome) may be
overwhelmed with social signals such as facial behaviors and expression and complexity
of them and they suffer from interacting with other individuals, therefore they would prefer
to be alone. That is why it would be difficult for individuals with autism to maintain social
interaction with others \cite{InfantileAutism1975}.\\

In order to diagnose and asses the aspects and score the social skill level of an individual
with autism, several protocols are available. One of the commercially available protocols
is called Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) \cite{AutismDiagno1989} that consists of four
modules and several structured tasks that are used to measure the social interaction levels
of the subject and examiner. We are inspired by ADOS in designing our intervention
protocols later described in Chapter 4. Hence, we briefly review ADOS in the next section.\\

\subsection{EDA Signals}
\subsection{Complex-Morlet (C-Morlet) Wavelet Transform}
\subsubsection{Continuous Wavelet Transform}
The EDA data recorded using the SC sensors are categorized as non-stationery signals\cite{AmbulatorySys2003, EmotionalState2013}. Hence, multiresolution analysis 
techniques are essentially suitable to study the qualitative components of these 
kinds of bio-signals \cite{AmbulatorySys2003}.  Note that continuous wavelet transform 
(CWT) is one of the strongest and most widely used analytical tools for multiresolution 
analysis. CWT has received considerable attention in processing signals with 
non-stationary spectra \cite{WaveletFilter1992, SignalDecomp1989}; therefore, it is 
utilized here to perform the time-frequency analysis of the EDA signals. In contrast 
to many existing methods that utilize the wavelet coefficients of the raw signal to 
extract features, our proposed method is essentially based on the spectrogram of the 
original data in a specific range of frequency (0.5, 50)Hz, which provides more 
information for other post-processing steps (i.e., feature extraction and classification).
We apply the wavelet transform at various scales corresponding to the 
aforementioned frequency range to calculate the spectrogram of the raw signal 
(i.e., Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), can also be used to calculate the 
spectrogram of the raw signal). In addition, as opposed to many related studies 
that utilize real-valued wavelet functions for feature extraction purposes, we have 
employed the complex Morlet (C-Morlet) function with the proposed approach, as it 
takes into account both the real and imaginary components of the raw signal, leading 
to a more detailed feature extraction.\\

The wavelet transform of a 1-D signal provides a decomposition of the time-domain 
sequence at different scales, which are inversely related to their frequency contents\cite{SignalDecomp1989, ContinuWavelet2009} . This requires the time-domain signal under 
investigation to be convolved with a time-domain function known as “mother wavelet”. 
The CWT applies the wavelet function at different scales with continuous time-shift 
of the mother wavelet over the input signal. As a consequence, it helps represent 
the EDA signals at different levels of resolution. For instance, it results in large 
coefficients in the transform domain when the wavelet function matches the input 
signal, providing a multiscale representation of the EDA signal.\\

Using a finite energy function $\Psi$(t) concentrated in the time domain, the CWT of 
a signal x(t) is given by X($\alpha$,b) as follows \cite{WaveletFilter1992}:

$X(a,b) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x(t)\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \Psi (\frac{t-b}{a}) dt$\newline

where, $\alpha$, is the scale factor and represents dilation or contraction of the wavelet 
function and b is the translation parameter that slides this function on the 
time-domain sequence under analysis. Therefore, $\Psi$($\alpha$,b) is the scaled and translated 
version of the corresponding mother wavelet. “*” is the conjugation operator.\\

Note that the wavelet coefficients obtained from Eq. (1) essentially evaluate the 
correlation between the signal x(t) and the wavelet function used at different 
translations and scales. This implies that the wavelet coefficients calculated 
over a range of scales and translations can be combined to reconstruct the original 
signal as follows:

$x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} X(a,b) \Psi (\frac{t-b}{a}) dadb$\newline

\subsubsection{Wavelet-Based Feature Extraction}
The time-frequency analysis of various bio-signals has been addressed in numerous 
related literature \cite{MultKernel2016, FFTSync2017}(Zhang et al., 2009). 
It has been shown that the wavelet-domain feature space can improve the recognition 
performance of different human activities using the signals emanated from the body 
responses. Therefore, it essentially enhances the classification performance due to 
the more distinctive feature space provided. \\

In this paper, we focus on the time-frequency analysis of the EDA signal to provide 
a new feature space based on which an emotion classification task can be done. As 
opposed to some related studies that employ the raw time-domain signals for 
classification purposes \cite{ArousalValence2017, EmotionClass2012}, we use the 
amplitude of the CWT of the EDA signals to generate the features and drive the 
classifier. Working in the wavelet-domain is essentially advantageous since the 
wavelet transform probes the given signal at different scales, extracting more 
information for other post-processing steps. In addition, the localized support 
of the wavelet functions enables CWT-based analysis to match to the local variations 
of the input time sequence \cite{WaveletFilter1992}. As a result, a more detailed 
representation of the signal is provided in comparison with the raw time-domain signal.\\


Figure \ref{cwt_eda} shows the amplitude of the CWT of a sample EDA signal at different scales 
using a complex Morlet (C-Morlet) wavelet function. Different scales of the wavelet functions are convolved with the original 
EDA signal to highlight different features of the raw data. As can be seen inside the bottom box, 
when the scaling parameter of the wavelet function increases, the larger features of 
the input signal are augmented. As can be seen, due to the localization 
property of the CWT, different structures of the input signal are extracted at each level 
of decomposition, providing useful information for analyzing the recorded EDA signals.\\

In this work, we have employed the C-Morlet wavelet function to process the acquired EDA 
signals, as it has been well used for time-frequency analysis of different bio-signals 
and classification \cite{MultKernel2016}. Figure \ref{feature} shows the wavelet-based 
feature extraction, Using the C-Morlet mother wavelet, the real and imaginary wavelet coefficients are calculated at different scales. Then, the amplitude of these coefficients is calculated to provide the corresponding spectrogram. This spectrogram is then used as the feature space.\\

On the other hand, the detailed structures of the 
signal are better extracted when the scaling factor decreases.. Note that the impact 
of different families of the wavelet functions 
(e.g., Symlets, Daubechies, Coiflets) on the emotion classification will be evaluated 
in the next subsection. The equation of the C-Morlet mother wavelet with fc as its central 
frequency and fb as the bandwidth parameter is given as follows:

$\Psi (t) = \frac{\exp(-t^2/f_b)}{\sqrt(\pi f_b)} \exp (j2\pi f_c t)$\newline

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}
The SVM classifier tends to separate data \\
${D = \{x_i, y_i\}^{N}_{i=1}, x_i\in^{d}, y_i\in\{-1,+1\}}$
by drawing an optimal hyperplane <w,x>+b=0 between classes such that the margin between 
them becomes maximum \cite{SupportVector1995}. With reference to Figure \ref{svm}, 
The decision boundary is shown by OH. Two hyperplanes H1 and H2 pass the support 
vectors that are circled inside the figure. H1 and H2 are 
the supporting planes and the optimal hyperplane (OH) splits this margin such that it 
stands at the same distance from each supporting hyperplane. This implies that the 
margin between H1 and H2 is equal to 2 / $\parallel$w$\parallel$.
In terms of linearly separable classes, the classifier is obtained by maximizing the 
margin 2 / $\parallel$w$\parallel$, which is equivalent to minimizing $\parallel$w$\parallel$ / 2 
with a constraint in convex quadratic programming (QP) as follows:

$\min \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 s.t. y_i(<w, x_i> + b) \ge 1$\newline

%\begin{figure}[tbp]
%	\begin{center}
%		\begin{tabular}{c}
%			\epsfig{figure=./chapters/fig/svm.eps, scale = 1}\label{svm} \\
%		\end{tabular}
%		\caption{Canonical SVM for classifying two linearly separable classes. } \label{svm}
%	\end{center}
%\end{figure}

where, w and b are the parameters of the hyperplane and <.,.> is the notation of 
the inner product.\\

However, different classes are seldom separable by a hyperplane since their samples 
are overlapped in the feature space. In such cases, a slack variable ${\xi_i\geq}$ 0 and a 
penalty parameter C $\geq$ 0 are used with the optimization step to obtain the best feasible 
decision boundary. It is given as:

$\min \frac{1}{2}||w||^2 + C(\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \xi_i) s.t. y_i(<w, x_i> + b) \ge 1 - \xi_i$\newline

Usually, various kernel functions are used to deal with the nonlinearly separable data. 
As a result, the original data xi is mapped onto another feature space through a 
projection function ${\varphi(\cdot)}$. It is not necessary to exactly know the equation of the 
projection ${\varphi(\cdot)}$, but one can use a kernel function ${k(x_i,x_j)=<\varphi(x_i),\varphi(x_j)>}$. 
This function is symmetric and satisfies the Mercer’s conditions. The Mercer’s conditions determine 
if a candidate kernel is actually an inner-product kernel. Let ${k(x_i,x_j)}$ be a continuous 
symmetric kernel defined in the closed interval ${t_1\leq t\leq t_2}$, the kernel can be expanded 
into series ${\Sigma_(n=1)^\infty = \lambda_n\varphi_n(x_i)\varphi_n(x_j)}$, where 
${\lambda_n > 0}$ are called eigenvalues and functions $\varphi$n are called eigenvectors in the expansion. 
The fact that all the eigenvalues are nonnegative means that the kernel is positive 
semidefinite \cite{SupportVector1995}. \\

To maximize the margin, H1 and H2 are pushed apart until they reach the support vectors 
on which the solution depends. To solve this optimization problem, the Lagrangian dual 
of Eq. (5) is used as follows:

$\max_\alpha \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \Sigma_{j=1}^{N} y_i y_j \alpha_i \alpha_j k(x_i, x_j)$\newline
$s.t. 0 \le \alpha_i \le C, \Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i y_i = 0, i = 1, ..., N$\newline

where, ${\alpha_i}$s are the Lagrangian multipliers in which just a few number of them are 
non-zero. These non-zero values are corresponding to the support vectors determining 
the parameters of the hyperplane ${w = \Sigma_(i=1)^N\alpha_iy_ix_i }$. Therefore, the label 
of the test sample ${(y_z)}$ is given by:
$y_z = sgn(\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i y_i k(x_i, z)) + b$\newline
