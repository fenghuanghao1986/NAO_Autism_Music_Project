No matter how many, words are pale compare to such friendship between Dr. Mahoor and I. Without his help and support, I might have been lost in my life and looking for something that I do not even know. However, with his help, I found my path and can roam in the scientific field, pursue novel ideas, and seek solutions. I cannot forget the very first day when Dr. Mahoor introduced me to NAO, the robot who I worked with. Thanks to Dr. Mahoor, who provided me with such and exceptional experience and helped me gain knowledge in the filed of Electrical and Computer Engineering and particularly Robotics!

More than everyone, I indebted to my mother for her enthusiastic encouragement, prayers, and unlimited support during all stages of my life. Understanding and tolerance helped us while argues and fights happened between us. I could not accomplish this work without her selfless love and assistance. Also, I must express my appreciation to my girlfriend, who stands beside me to conquer the very dark time.

In the past eight years, I have been working with these special children and I cannot stop thinking of their future life after ten years or even more. The honor goes to my late friend, Mr. Masoud Bahramisharif, without his help, I was not able to even begin this project. Mr. Hosein M Golshan provided his endless support for this fantastic work as well, which helps me to complete it on time. I also want to send my appreciation to all the committee members, Dr. Kimon Valavanis, Dr. Tim Sweeney, and Dr. Matthew Rutherford. I would thank them all for their support and serving on my defense committee.
